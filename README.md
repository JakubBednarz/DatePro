# DatePro
Simple exercise for formating of dates.

Currently only days, month, and years are supported and should be inputed as:

D - Day, no leading zero for single-digit days.
DD - Day, leading zero for single-digit days.
M - Month, no leading zero for single-digit months.
MM - Month, leading zero for single-digit months.
YY - Year as last two digits, leading zero for years less than 10
YYYY - year from 1 to 5 digits

Only one date can be formated, all digits in dateAsString must be represented as format in inputDateFormat.
